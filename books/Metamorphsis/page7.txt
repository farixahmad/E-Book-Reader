chaos. He told himself once more that it was not possible
for him to stay in bed and that the most sensible thing to
do would be to get free of it in whatever way he could at
whatever sacrifice. At the same time, though, he did not
forget to remind himself that calm consideration was
much better than rushing to desperate conclusions. At
times like this he would direct his eyes to the window
and look out as clearly as he could, but unfortunately,
even the other side of the narrow street was enveloped in
morning fog and the view had little confidence or cheer
to offer him. "Seven o'clock, alreadft, he said to himself
when the clock struck again, "seven o'clock, and there's
still a fog like this." And he lay there quietly a while
longer, breathing lightly as if he perhaps expected the
total stillness to bring things back to their real and
natural state.
But then he said to himself: "Before it strikes quarter
past seven I'll definitely have to have got properly out of
bed. And by then somebody will have come round from
work to ask what's happened to me as well, as they open
up at work before seven o'clock." And so he set himself to
the task of swinging the entire length of his body out of
the bed all at the same time. If he succeeded in falling
out of bed in this way and kept his head raised as he did
so he could probably avoid injuring it. His back seemed
to be quite hard, and probably nothing would happen to
it falling onto the carpet. His main concern was for the
loud noise he was bound to make, and which even
through all the doors would probably raise concern if not
alarm. But it was something that had to be risked.
When Gregor was already sticking half way out of the
bed - the new method was more of a game than an effort,

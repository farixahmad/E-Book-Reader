all he had to do was rock back and forth - it occurred to
him how simple everything would be if somebody came
to help him. Two strong people - he had his father and
the maid in mind - would have been more than enough;
they would only have to push their arms under the dome
of his back, peel him away from the bed, bend down
with the load and then be patient and careful as he
swang over onto the floor, where, hopefully, the little
legs would find a use. Should he really call for help
though, even apart from the fact that all the doors were
locked? Despite all the difficulty he was in, he could not
suppress a smile at this thought.
After a while he had already moved so far across that
it would have been hard for him to keep his balance if he
rocked too hard. The time was now ten past seven and
he would have to make a final decision very soon. Then
there was a ring at the door of the flat. "Thatll be
someone from work", he said to himself, and froze very
still, although his little legs only became all the more
lively as they danced around. For a moment everything
remained quiet. "They're not opening the door", Gregor
said to himself, caught in some nonsensical hope. But
then of course, the maid's firm steps went to the door as
ever and opened it. Gregor only needed to hear the
visitor's first words of greeting and he knew who it was -
the chief clerk himself. Why did Gregor have to be the
only one condemned to work for a company where they
immediately became highly suspicious at the slightest
shortcoming? Were all employees, every one of them,
louts, was there not one of them who was faithful and
devoted who would go so mad with pangs of conscience
that he couldn't get out of bed if he didn't spend at least
a couple of hours in the morning on company business?

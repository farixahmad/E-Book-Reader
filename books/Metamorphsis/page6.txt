he finally managed to do what he wanted with that leg,
all the others seemed to be set free and would move
about painfully. "This is something that can't be done in
bed", Gregor said to himself, "so don't keep trying to do
it".
The first thing he wanted to do was get the lower part
of his body out of the bed, but he had never seen this
lower part, and could not imagine what it looked like; it
turned out to be too hard to move; it went so slowly; and
finally, almost in a frenzy, when he carelessly shoved
himself forwards with all the force he could gather, he
chose the wrong direction, hit hard against the lower
bedpost, and learned from the burning pain he felt that
the lower part of his body might well, at present, be the
most sensitive.
So then he tried to get the top part of his body out of
the bed first, carefully turning his head to the side. This
he managed quite easily, and despite its breadth and its
weight, the bulk of his body eventually followed slowly in
the direction of the head. But when he had at last got his
head out of the bed and into the fresh air it occurred to
him that if he let himself fall it would be a miracle if his
head were not injured, so he became afraid to carry on
pushing himself forward the same way. And he could not
knock himself out now at any price; better to stay in bed
than lose consciousness.
It took just as much effort to get back to where he had
been earlier, but when he lay there sighing, and was once
more watching his legs as they struggled against each
other even harder than before, if that was possible, he
could think of no way of bringing peace and order to this
